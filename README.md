# test_task_codibly_sysa

<p>This is my test task for the company <b>Codibly</b> for the position of an intern.</p>

<p>Details:</p>
<p>1) Implemented with some free interpretation of the task.</p>
<p>2) Test coverage 100%</p>
<p>3) The second task is done medium elegantly... :)

<p>Thank you for your attention!</p>
